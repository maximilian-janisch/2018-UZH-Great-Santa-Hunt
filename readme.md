# Great Santa Hunt (Programming Project)
## Short Description
This repository contains a small game in which deers collect resources and use them to distribute presents to houses. It has a graphical user interface written using PyQt. 

This game was a project for the [programming course 2018 at the math department of the University of Zurich](https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=ve_vo_det&key1=0&key2=3323&key3=393&semId=37).
### To run
Install Python 3.7 or newer from https://www.python.org/ and install PyQt5 or newer from https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html. Then download all the files in this repository, put them in a dedicated directory and run the file main.py.

## Todo:

* ~~Live distribution paths are a bit buggy~~ **Maximilian**
* ~~Distribution path generation is not good, oposite angles are handled as close:-(~~ **Maximilian**
* ~~GUI draws path of deers~~ **Maximilian and Atsuhiro**
* ~~Overview of collected resources now in csf~~ **(Completed by Robert)**
* ~~Bug with markers, sometimes they do not get erased by the last deer~~ **(Completed by Robert)**
* ~~Export the time used for collection to csv (2.3)~~  **(Completed by Robert)**
* ~~Show pop-up after toy production (6, second point)~~ **Atsuhiro**
* ~~Collection ends when one location of each resource is emptied (1.11)~~  **Maximilian**
* ~~More than one location per resource possible~~ **(Completed by Maximilian)**
* ~~real-time GUI for distribution (4.2)~~ **(Completed by Robert, Maximilian, Atsuhiro)**

Need to do
* Report according to mail from Jon Eugster, 11.12.2018


Nice to have
* Distribution of data about toy distribution (4.4)
* Production of toys behaves a little unintuitive
