Need to do

* Show pop-up after toy production (6, second point)
* make distribution loop work with iter_
* fix problems with smoothness >1
* real-time GUI for distribution (4.2)
* Deers go home before kids wake up (4.3)
* Distribution of data about toy distribution (4.4)
* Report according to mail from Jon Eugster, 11.12.2018

Nice to have
